# AI Mental-Health Journaling Assistant

**Tagline:** Helping you reflect on your emotions, one journal entry at a time.

## Project Overview
AI Mental-Health Journaling Assistant is a no-code AI application built using the Airia platform.  
The goal of this project is to provide a simple and supportive space for users to write daily journal entries, understand their emotional state, and receive empathetic, non-clinical feedback.

This project is designed for emotional reflection and self-awareness, not for medical diagnosis or therapy.

## How It Works
1. The user enters a journal entry through a chat-based interface.  
2. The Emotion Detection Agent analyzes the emotional tone of the input.  
3. The Supportive Response Agent generates a calm and empathetic response.  
4. The final response is shown back to the user via the Airia Chat Widget.

## Key Features
- Emotion Detection Agent for identifying emotional tone  
- Supportive Response Agent for generating kind, non-judgmental responses  
- Chat-based user interface built using Airia  
- Safety-focused design (no clinical or medical advice)  
- Manual evaluation of responses for quality and edge cases  

## Tech Stack
- Platform: Airia (No-Code AI Platform)  
- Interface: Airia Chat Widget  
- Architecture: Multi-agent workflow (Emotion Detection → Supportive Response)  

## Project Status
- Core agents are created and refined  
- User interface is integrated  
- Safety and edge-case considerations are documented  
- Live execution is currently paused due to billing limits  
- Manual evaluation and design-level testing were used for validation  

## Repository Structure
- `screenshots/` – Contains screenshots of agents, workflows, and interface  
- `progress.md` – Daily progress summary for the challenge  
- `README.md` – Project documentation  

## Future Improvements
- Weekly emotion summaries and trend insights  
- Emotional memory to track long-term patterns  
- Visual dashboard for mood trends  
- Live testing and deployment once executions are enabled  
- Improved UI and user onboarding flow
